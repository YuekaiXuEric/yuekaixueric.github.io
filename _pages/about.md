Hi! I'm an undergraduate student and researcher at the University of Washington. I double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in Data Science option. I am fortunated to be co-advised by Professor [Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) and Professor [Linda G Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/), and pleased mentored by [Zixuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yjKOHbEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in UW CSE and Computational Biology.

My research interests are broadly in AI4Science, including the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I am especially passionate about vision-language pretraining, multimodal learning, foundation models, and their applications in biomedicine and clinical medicine.

Beside from research, I'm also a member in [UWClassmates](https://uwclassmate.com/) technology group. We maintain and add new features for the UW courses evaluation and discussion [website](https://uwclassmate.com/)
